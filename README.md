# website

an upgrade of my original website, which became inconsistant as time went on

## new features

**light/dark mode**, so [meew0](https://twitter.com/meew0) or that 4 other people who enjoy light mode can also experience it in this website :D

**colorblind mode**, because the original website was written and brought online by [tristan poland](https://github.com/tristanpoland) **<u>and because accessibility</u>** <!-- fuck markdownlint -->

**consistancy**, something the latest version of Windows 10 cannot achieve
###### (Windows 11 is more consistant, and microsoft is heading for redemption, that is for sure.) <!-- go away markdownlint -->

**minimalistic design**, or at least i tried

**simple framework** and easy to read+easy usuable css

**FINALLY EMBEDS** i finally added embeds.
