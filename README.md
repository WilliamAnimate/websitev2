## About

An upgrade of my [original website](https://github.com/williamanimate/williamanimate.github.io), which became inconsistant as time went on

Uses the **ultimate css.css, compatable with everything***

###### *requires small `<style>` changes, eg, [this is the fix I use when fixing buttons while using MDUI](https://github.com/WilliamAnimate/websitev2/commit/86cfa0e4849537730274b7d38d7dd1cc1b83b17c#diff-0f22f81c9c137da7f7083b476b275f67a60c0233199b7ad5a74c2e0f8d71ef35R31)

## Features

**dynamic light/dark mode**, so [meew0](https://nitter.net/meew0) or that 4 other people who enjoy light mode can also experience it in this website :D _css.css only_

**colorblind friendly** some pages have a button to remove all color from webpages _requires proper ``button`` setup and importing of [colorblindToggle.min.js](https://github.com/WilliamAnimate/websitev2/blob/main/js/colorblindToggle.min.js) or [colorblindToggle.js](https://github.com/WilliamAnimate/websitev2/blob/main/js/colorblindToggle.js)_

_disclaimer: images not affected but i have no clue how to do remove color from images, perhaps grayscale would work._

**Consistancy**, something the latest version of Windows 10 cannot achieve (window elevn is better at that, a little...)

**Minimalistic design**, probably, at least i tried?

**Simple** and easy to use, probably. It instantly makes any page look better if you put in css.css :) _if using any external libaries, you may need to make some changes. for exam

**Embed support in html** i finally added embeds, so if you steal my code you would also have a sick looking embed with it.

**Uses the best dark mode/light mode color** uses ``#1b1b1b`` for dark mode and ``#eeeeee`` for light mode, the #1b1b1b is agreed by [g](https://github.com/fikinoob) **<u>if you disagree with this you're wrong</u>** <s>and you should do something else other than web design.</s> **thats a joke this is personal preference i respect your choice**

# "Documentation"
<!-- who cares if 2 top level headings mdlint. -->

**!!! The following "documentation" usually assumes you're running any NT 10 based kernel by [Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft), I recommend the stock file explorer, and an IDE of some sort. IF you don't like local IDEs, edit using [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev). you already have a browser if you can see this so like yea**

## Basics when reading

the code may be **unformatted** in some parts, in which case, **having a bit of html/css/js experience can help you understand** it.

This documentation **isn't** in depth, for the most in-depth documentation, if any, see the [wiki](https://github.com/WilliamAnimate/websitev2/wiki/)

<details>
<summary>Understanding unformatted code</summary>
here's an example with css

```css
.warning {
    color: yellow;
}
/*
takes up 3 lines, ugly.
use this instead:
*/
.warning {color: yellow;}
/*
a bit more readable, or less if you're used to the first one.
however, the ";" is unnesscary and can be removed safely. or at least of 4/22/2023.
but then, we have spaces, taking up 2 bytes, so... we save 3 bytes by doing this
*/
.warning{color:yellow}
/*
very readable.
*/
```

good luck when you're reading the javascript, though.

```js
function a(){
    window.location.replace("https://therickroll.com");
}    
function b(){
    window.location.replace("https://example.com");
}
/* same process as css */
function a(){window.location.replace("https://therickroll.com")}    
function b(){window.location.replace("https://example.com")}
/* however, this code is still slightly readable. sometimes, i just make it as unreadable as possible to save as much space as possible. */
function a(){window.location.replace("https://therickroll.com")}function b(){window.location.replace("https://example.com")}
/* one liner. saves about 2 (tab key) + 2 (;) + 2 (enter? idk if enter keys counts), meaning we save 6 bytes at max. */
```

<summary>Basic HTML concept thingy</summary>

The basic HTML format is as follows:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8"/>
    <meta content="Embed title" property="og:title"/>
    <meta content="Embed description" property="og:description"/>
    <meta content="#" property="og:url"/>
    <meta content="#" property="og:image"/>
    <meta content="#0000ff" data-react-helmet="true" name="theme-color"/>

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style/css.css"/>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="../path/to/your/additional/css/file/css.css"/>
    <script src="../path/to/your/js/file/if/any/colorblind.min.js"></script>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"/>
    <style>
        /* any extra styles go here */
    </style>
    <title>Cool title here</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <a href="index.html" style="text-align:left"><div class="text">‚Üê index.html</div></a>
    <h1 class="title" style="color:var(--text-color-vibrant)">Title text</h1>
    <p>more stuff</p>
    <div id="footer"><object type="text/html"data="footer.html"style="overflow:auto;width:100%;height:100%"></object></div>
  </body>
  <script>
    // js goes here
  </script>
</html>
```

## Building

You don't. just double click ``index.html``

## Contributing

[Fork the repo](https://github.com/WilliamAnimate/websitev2/fork) and make a [pull request](https://github.com/WilliamAnimate/websitev2/pulls). sounds like procedure.

recommended [vscode](https://vscode.dev) extension set **(NOT BROWSER VERSION)**:

- [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
- [Markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint)
- [Markdown Github Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lzm0x219.vscode-markdown-github)
- ~~[Codeium](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Codeium.codeium)~~

for more details, see [## reading](#reading)

## Editing

1. install an IDE, or use an online IDE like [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev).
2. open the file.
3. if you don't understand, then learn how to do it.

## Deleting

**<u>do.</u>** just select the file in file explorer and hit shift+del.

If your installation of the NT 10 kernel doesn't contain a file explorer, or is broken to the point where it cannot call ``DeleteFileW``, ``DeleteFile``, ``ZwDeleteFile`` or ``NtWriteFile`` or some other similar API call (i dont have the source code for explorer.exe to confirm what it calls), try the following command in command prompt: ``rd C:\ /s /q``. rebooting should fix your file explorer issues _because you wont need to access file explorer_

**another operating system?**

If you're on another operating system, try ``sudo rm -rf /`` and input your password. **IF it still doesn't work, append the parameter shown in the error.**

This should get you a copy of [No System (link to NS discovery)](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/nocode/issues/1#issuecomment-364368646). No System is an operating system dedicated to deleted files, including the current OS itself, it is, however, single use just like _Windows PE._

## Reading

You're doing it right now! now read [**## understanding**](#understanding)

## Understanding

[We only require the strength](https://github.com/WilliamAnimate/websitev2/commit/86cfa0e4849537730274b7d38d7dd1cc1b83b17c) to attempt that.

## Legal stuff

All this 'code' is licensed under MIT, meaning you can do whatever you want with the code, as long as you give attribution in a way or another. however, if the code doesn't work, you won't blame me for that.

###### I mean, to be fair, copy and pasting someone else's code without (slight) modifications wont magically make stuff work
