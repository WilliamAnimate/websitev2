<summary>Honorable mention: guess the game</summary>

> Writing a Steam review is a quite mundane task for some, some people like writing joke reviews or reviews with just two words, or rate a review as not recommended and say why they recommended it. Personally, that's quite scummy.

> However, as you're reading this, you should now realize that I am writing a proper review for this game that I enjoyed a lot.

> But as I now realize, the hours of preparation I spent writing this review so far, are taking a serious toll on my mind, but giving up is not an option, even in a game with no goal, which, by golly, is the game I am reviewing.

> Of course, you may now be asking, why am I writing a review that nobody will read? Well, nobody said it isn't allowed to have documentation in a closed source project, code comments that only you will see, and you do not have to disclose your most prized creations if you don't want to.

> Unfortunately, once again, as I am reviewing this game, it remains a straining task to give it a good review, not to mention, a rating. No matter what kind of grading system you use, your basic formula will always be this:
> Computers are better if they are better at math, Knifes are better if they're sharper, and Schools are better if they bother to teach you anything remotely useful that you will ever use in your life, ranging from when you are IN the school to when you graduate, having near unlimited freedom to do what you want without the stress of doing well, Vacuum cleaners are better if they suck, IDEs are better if they have useful features.
You should now be seeing a pattern: If it does its original, primary task more efficiently, it is certainly better.

> Knowing games, some of them either are designed to make you relax after a long day, or designed to make you angry. I have played multiple games that provide entertainment, but also some that make you just want to leave a "Not Recommended" review. I would have to discuss this in my review to help anyone, who is potentially reading this, decide if this is a game to buy and play.

> Even so, every person has their own bias, just like whether the dress is white and gold or black and blue, or if they like story games like OneShot and Undertale, or FPS shooters like Half-Life, Half-Life 2, Half-Life: Alyx, and one day, before our time is up, Half-Life 3. Sometimes, people also give the game a review and rating that says "Not Recommended" simply because they couldn't afford a better-performing calculator to run math on, so, if possible, look up gameplay footage and see if this game is something you would like to buy and play.

> Of course, another required step that we have to go through is simply, why we can even write on our modern calculators, specifically something some of us, including me, call "Steam Reviews", something most of our ancestors could not do, no matter how much they wanted to.

> My review also has to be comprehensive, but potentially concise so this review does not have more than 4000 characters because not everyone likes reading, but it looks like you certainly do, in which case, I don't know what to say...
<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line -->

> Having all that in mind, the following words below are my review, crafted off hours of work with preparation and consideration, that you would know if you read everything:

> I hate this game, which is why...
> I recommend it!

> (Sorry for my bad spelling lol)
