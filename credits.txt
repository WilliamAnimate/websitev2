https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4151743/how-can-i-change-the-thickness-of-my-hr-tag#4151770

css: i think 99% me.
html: almost all me (except for the footer link-code (not the footer itself) attribution is somewhere in the code but i can't find it, once i do i'll put it here.)
js: i think its all me as of right now.

and you, for reading this. why?
