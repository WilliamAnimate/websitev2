        <h1>Windowed application documentation</h1>
        <p>It is extremely simple, there are 2 ways to implement this, one way allows you to use the PAL, the other way is significantly more difficult.</p>
        <h2>Using the <b>BUILT IN</b> app system:</h2>
        <p>coming soon</p>
        <h3>Using the PAL libary for your app.</h3>
        <p>you don't</p>
        <h2>Building your own applications from scratch, literally.</h2>
        <p>so basically have a broadcast listen for the "os_createapp" broadcast or something i don't have it open right now<br>then when receiving such request, check the 'os_appid' varable, if it equals your appid, then run your program's initiation stuff</p>
        <p class="caution caut-bg">⚠️ caution<br><span style="font-size:0.6em">please take extreme measures to prevent appid overlapping, <b>make sure your appid does NOT overlap with any applications.<br><u>more importantly, overlapping exclusivemode applications.</u></b> Failure to do so may result in complete breakdown of the app system.</span></p>

        <p class="warning warn-bg">⚠️ warning<br><span style="font-size:0.6em">I would highly recommend that you don't intentally use this to break stuff. best way to break everything is deleting the <code>onecore</code> sprite and then trying to launch applications, sure, some may work but everything else breaks.</span></p>

        <p class="yes yes-bg">yes do THIS<br><span style="font-size:0.6em">currently a test for the rule <code>yes</code>. I still have a ways to go before this is done.</span></p>
